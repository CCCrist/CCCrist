## Hello there 👋

I'm **Crist Natanael Fernandes**.<br>
Information Systems Student with a deep focus on bridging the gap between raw data and production-ready AI systems.
Currently, I am sharpening my expertise as an AI Engineering Fellow,
where I build end-to-end machine learning pipelines—from exploratory data analysis to model deployment (MLOps). <br>
My goal is to transform complex datasets into scalable, intelligent solutions that drive real-world impact.

**Core Technical Stack:** <br>
* **Programming**: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn)<br>
* **Machine Learning**: Classification, Regression, Clustering, and Deep Learning (CV & NLP)<br>
* **Deployment & Ops**: MLOps, Model Monitoring, CI/CD for ML Systems<br>
  
Open to collaborations and opportunities in Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, and AI Development.
